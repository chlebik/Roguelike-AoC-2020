# Roguelike Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains the source code of my **Roguelike Advent of Code 2020** project, which I've written for my
blog - <a href="http://baremetaldev.com">BareMetalDev</a>. Its goal was to get more familiar with *C programming*.
Not using simple short hello-world-like programs, but fully-scoped multi-file project. I've followed the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkTXsX7igf8erbWGYT4iSAhpnJLJ0Nk5G">online video roguelike tutorial</a>,
and the code presented here is my (upgraded) version of the author's code.

All of **27** posts (**26** original lessons and one additional post with code improvements) can be found on <a
href="https://www.baremetaldev.com/roguelike-advent-of-code-2020/">BareMetalDev blog</a>. Any comments, ideas or bug reports are welcome.
